## 🌟 What is GUL?

GUL is a modern, autonomous-first programming language that combines Python's simplicity with Rust's safety and performance. Use it for everything from web development to scientific computing and embedded systems.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install GUL compiler - to be implemented
## curl -sSf https://gul.org/install.sh | sh

# Run a hello world program
gul run hello.mn
```
