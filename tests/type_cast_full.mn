# Type Casting Tests

# Test 1: int to float via variable
let x = 10
let y = @flt(x)
print(y)

# Test 2: direct float cast
var z = @flt(10)
print(z)

# Test 3: float to int
let f = 10.7
let i = @int(f)
print(i)

# Test 4: float arithmetic after cast
let a = 5
let b = @flt(a) + 2.5
print(b)

# Test 5: int operations after cast
let c = @int(7.9)
print(c)
